	      <h2>About this App</h2>
		  <p>GeekTime for iOS is a native implementation of the smash-hit time telling website <a href="http://geektime.org">http://geektime.org</a>.</p>
	      <h2>What is Geek Time?</h2>
	      <p>There are 86,400 seconds in a day. The closest power of two is 65,536. Instead of using seconds, <b>Geek Time</b> divides the day into 65,536 units and 
	        then displays those units, relative to coordinated universal time (UTC), in hexadecimal.</p>
	      <p>The day is just the 0-indexed day of the year in hexadecimal (at UTC).</p>
	      <p>The glyph underneath is an example of the Unicode character at the code point corresponding to the current Geek Time.
	          The idea to include this was suggested by <a href="http://twitter.com/joshourisman">@joshourisman</a>.</p>
	      <h2>What use is it?</h2>
	      <p>It's a single time people can use to coordinate events on the Internet. If you round to the nearest <tt>0x100</tt> you'll be within six minutes.</p>
	      <h2>Didn't Swatch do something like this?</h2>
	      <p>Yeah, but they divided the day into 1,000. That's just not geeky enough!</p>
	      <h2>Are you serious?</h2>
	      <p>No, this was just done for fun. But hey, some people are already finding it useful.</p>
	      <h2>Is this based on some time server?</h2>
	      <p>Not yet. Currently it's based on the local time of your device, but we'd like to synchronize with a more reliable source.</p>
